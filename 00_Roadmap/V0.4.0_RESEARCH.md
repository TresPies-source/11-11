# UI Research Findings for v0.4.0

## App 1: Cursor IDE

### Key Observations

**Agent Representation:**
- **Agent Panel (Right Side):** Dedicated panel showing "IN PROGRESS" and "READY FOR REVIEW" tasks
- **Task Cards:** Each task shows:
  - Title
  - Status (Generating, Ready for Review)
  - Time estimate (30m, 45m)
  - Code changes (+37 -0, +135 -21)
  - Visual indicator (sparkle icon for generating)
- **Agent Chat:** Inline chat interface with agent responses
- **Model Selector:** Dropdown to choose between GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok Code

**Layout:**
- **Three-Column Layout:**
  - Left: File tree / navigation
  - Center: Code editor (primary workspace)
  - Right: Agent panel (collapsible)
- **Flexible:** Agent panel can be shown/hidden
- **Context-Aware:** Agent panel shows relevant tasks for current workspace

**Onboarding:**
- Not visible on features page (likely on first launch)
- Focus on "Download" CTA

**Key Strengths:**
- Clear visual hierarchy (tasks organized by status)
- Real-time progress indicators ("Generating...")
- Code change metrics visible at a glance
- Model selection is prominent and easy to access
- Agent panel doesn't interfere with main workspace

**Key Weaknesses:**

## Inspiration for 11-11

### Agent Representation
- **Status-Based Organization:** "IN PROGRESS" vs "READY FOR REVIEW" is clear
- **Task Cards:** Show agent activity, progress, and results
- **Model Selector:** Prominent, easy to switch between models
- **Real-Time Indicators:** "Generating..." with sparkle icon

### Flexible Layout
- **Three-Column:** Navigation | Workspace | Agent Panel
- **Collapsible Panels:** Agent panel can be hidden when not needed
- **Persistent:** Agent panel stays visible across file changes

### What to Adapt
- **Multi-Agent Indicator:** Show which agent is active (Supervisor, Dojo, Librarian)
- **Agent Handoffs:** Visualize when Supervisor routes to Librarian
- **Conversation History:** Show past agent interactions, not just current tasks
- **Seed Integration:** Show relevant seeds in agent panel

## App 2: Windsurf Cascade

### Key Observations from Screenshot

**Agent Representation:**
- **Right-Side Chat Panel:** Dedicated "Cascade" panel for AI interaction
- **Conversational Interface:** Natural language chat with AI agent
- **Progress Indicators:** Shows what the agent is analyzing (e.g., "Analyzed app.py [1-100]", "Analyzed requirements.txt [1-11]")
- **Error Handling:** Red error messages inline (e.g., "Error: failed to run command pip: exec: 'pip': executable file not found in $PATH")
- **Action Buttons:** "Run this project" button at top of chat
- **Model Indicator:** Shows "Cascade 3.5 Sonnet" at bottom of chat panel

**Layout:**
- **Two-Column Layout:**
  - Left: Code editor (primary workspace)
  - Right: Cascade chat panel (persistent)
- **Tab System:** Multiple tabs at top (Explore, Refactor, Add Docstring)
- **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Shows file path (app.py > game_state > Explore)

**Agent Behavior:**
- **Proactive Analysis:** Agent automatically analyzes files when asked to help
- **Step-by-Step Progress:** Shows each file analyzed with line counts
- **Contextual Understanding:** Agent understands the project structure (Flask app with Python and JavaScript)
- **Error Detection:** Identifies missing dependencies and suggests fixes

**Key Strengths:**
- Persistent chat panel (doesn't hide)
- Clear progress indicators (shows what agent is doing)
- Inline error messages (easy to spot problems)
- Contextual awareness (agent knows the project structure)

**Key Weaknesses:**
- No visual indicator of "agent status" (is it thinking? waiting? done?)
- Chat panel takes up significant horizontal space
- No way to see multiple agent conversations simultaneously

## App 3: Replit Agent

### Key Observations from Screenshot

**Agent Representation:**
- **Bottom Status Bar:** "The agent was paused." message in purple bar at bottom
- **Agent Tab:** Dedicated "Agent" tab at top (alongside "features.tsx" tab)
- **Progress Tab:** Separate "Progress" tab showing agent activity
- **Visual Overlay:** Large modal/overlay showing "Transform Your Workflow" (likely agent-generated preview)

**Layout:**
- **Three-Column Layout:**
  - Left: File tree / navigation
  - Center: Code editor OR agent preview
  - Right: (not visible in this screenshot, but likely exists)
- **Tab System:** Multiple tabs for files and agent views
- **Bottom Status Bar:** Shows agent status persistently

**Agent Behavior:**
- **Pausable:** Agent can be paused/resumed by user
- **Preview Generation:** Agent generates visual previews of what it's building
- **Progress Tracking:** Separate "Progress" tab for detailed agent activity

**Key Strengths:**
- Agent status always visible (bottom bar)
- Agent can be paused (user control)
- Visual previews of agent work (not just code)
- Separate progress view (detailed activity log)

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Agent preview takes over entire center panel (disruptive)
- No indication of which agent is active (only one agent visible)
- Status bar message is passive (doesn't show active work)

## Key Insights for 11-11 v0.4.0

### What Works Well (Adopt)
1. **Persistent Agent Panel** (Cursor, Windsurf) - Don't hide agent activity
2. **Progress Indicators** (Windsurf) - Show what agent is analyzing/doing
3. **Status Bar** (Replit) - Always-visible agent status at bottom
4. **Task Organization** (Cursor) - Group agent work by status (IN PROGRESS, READY FOR REVIEW)
5. **Collapsible Panels** (Cursor) - User can hide agent panel when not needed

### What Doesn't Work (Avoid)

2. **Isolated Agent Views** (11-11 current) - Agent activity should be visible from Workbench
3. **No Status Indicator** (Windsurf) - User should always know if agent is working
4. **Single Agent View** (all three) - 11-11 has multiple agents, should show them all

### Unique Opportunities for 11-11
1. **Multi-Agent Visualization:** Show Supervisor, Dojo, Librarian, Debugger simultaneously
2. **Agent Handoff Visualization:** Show when Supervisor routes to Librarian
3. **Seed Integration:** Show relevant seeds in agent panel (unique to 11-11)
