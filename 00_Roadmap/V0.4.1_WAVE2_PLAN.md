# Wave 2 (v0.4.1) Development Plan

**Author:** Manus AI (Dojo)
**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Purpose:** Comprehensive plan for Wave 2 development, including refactoring of Librarian/Greenhouse and implementation of new features.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Wave 2 will focus on two key areas:

1.  **Refactoring & Redesign:** Simplify the Librarian page and build a proper Greenhouse page from scratch.
2.  **New Features:** Implement the core interactive workflows of Dojo Genesis (Workbench, Agent Panel, Seeds UI).

## 2. Refactoring Priorities

### A. Librarian Page (`/librarian`)

**Problem:** The current Librarian page is too busy at the bottom, with crowded Greenhouse and Library sections.

**Solution:**
-   **Simplify:** Remove the embedded Greenhouse and Library sections from the main Librarian page.
-   **Focus:** The main Librarian page will now focus exclusively on search, suggestions, and recent activity.
-   **Navigation:** Add clear navigation links to the dedicated Greenhouse and Commons pages.

### B. Greenhouse Page (`/librarian/greenhouse`)

**Problem:** The Greenhouse page is currently a blank slate.

**Solution:**
-   **Build from Scratch:** Create a new, full-featured Greenhouse page that allows users to:
    -   View all their saved prompts.
    -   Search and filter saved prompts.
    -   Manage prompt status (active, saved, archived).
    -   Share prompts to the Commons.

## 3. New Feature Priorities

### A. Workbench Redesign

-   **Monaco Editor:** Integrate the Monaco editor for a professional prompt engineering experience.
-   **Tab Management:** Allow users to work on multiple prompts at once with a tabbed interface.
-   **Flexible Panels:** Use resizable panels to create a customizable layout.
-   **Action Bar:** Include a dedicated action bar with Test, Save, and Export buttons.

### B. Agent Activity Panel

-   **Real-time Status:** Display the real-time status of all agents (Supervisor, Dojo, Librarian, Debugger).
-   **Collapsible Panel:** Create a collapsible panel (80px ↔ 320px) that can be expanded for more detail.
-   **Agent Handoffs:** Visualize the handoff of tasks between agents.

### C. Seeds UI (Memory Garden)

-   **Dedicated Page:** Create a dedicated page for the Memory Garden.
-   **Lifecycle Management:** Allow users to manage the lifecycle of their seeds (Keep, Grow, Compost, Replant).
-   **Seed Cards:** Display seeds as cards with their current status and actions.

1.  **Librarian & Greenhouse Refactor** (1-2 weeks)
2.  **Workbench Redesign** (2-3 weeks)
3.  **Agent Activity Panel** (1-2 weeks)
4.  **Seeds UI** (1-2 weeks)

**Total Estimated Time:** 5-9 weeks

## 5. Next Steps

I will now generate the Zenflow prompts for each of these features, starting with the Librarian and Greenhouse refactor. I will deliver them in batches as they are ready.
