# 🌱 11-11: The Seed Garden & Living Roadmap

**Author:** Manus AI (Dojo) & The 11-11 Community
**Status:** Evergreen & Ever-Growing

Welcome to the living heart of the **11-11 Sustainable Intelligence OS**. This is not a static document; it's a garden. Here, we plant seeds, nurture saplings, and harvest the fruits of our collective imagination. This is our project diary, our idea incubator, and our shared vision for a more sustainable and intelligent future.

## 🌳 The Garden: Planting Seeds of the Future

This is where we cultivate ideas. Drop a seed, add to an existing one, or just watch them grow. Each seed is a potential future for 11-11.

### 🌱 **Core Workbench & UI**

*   **Seed:** `Dynamic Layouts` — What if the workbench could reconfigure itself based on the task? A "focus mode" for writing, a "split-screen" for coding and previewing, a "zen mode" for deep thinking.
*   **Seed:** `Themed Workspaces` — Imagine having different themes for your workspace that change the UI, the sounds, and even the AI's personality. A "rainy day cafe" theme for creative writing, a "hacker den" for coding, a "serene library" for research.
*   **Seed:** `AI-Powered Command Palette` — A command palette that not only finds files and runs commands but also anticipates your needs, suggests next steps, and even writes code snippets for you.

### 🌱 **The Global Commons & Wikipedia of Prompts**

*   **Seed:** `Prompt Lineage & Forking` — Visually trace the history of a prompt, see how it has been forked and improved by the community, and merge the best ideas back into your own work.
*   **Seed:** `AI-Critiqued Prompts` — An AI agent that reviews your prompts, suggests improvements, and provides a "prompt score" based on clarity, creativity, and effectiveness.
*   **Seed:** `Community-Curated Prompt Packs` — Themed collections of prompts created by the community for specific tasks, like "The Ultimate Guide to Writing a Novel" or "The Startup Founder's Toolkit."

### 🌱 **The Librarian & Semantic Search**

*   **Seed:** `The Proactive Librarian` — An AI librarian that not only finds what you're looking for but also suggests related ideas, uncovers hidden connections, and brings you serendipitous discoveries.
*   **Seed:** `Multi-Modal Search` — Search not just with text, but with images, sounds, and even sketches. Find that image you saw last week by drawing a rough sketch of it.
*   **Seed:** `The Memory Palace` — A 3D visualization of your knowledge base, where you can walk through your ideas, see how they connect, and discover new insights.

## 🍂 The Seasons: A Month-to-Month Project Diary

This is our high-level view of the project's journey. It's a living document that we'll update as we go.

### **❄️ Winter (Jan - Mar 2026): The Foundation**

*   **Focus:** Building the core workbench, stabilizing the hybrid sync, and planting the first seeds of the Librarian.
*   **January:** `[Complete]` Initial setup, project structure, and core UI shell.
*   **February:** `[In Progress]` Hybrid sync MVP (Google Drive & GitHub), basic file tree and editor.
*   **March:** `[Planned]` The Librarian v0.1: basic semantic search and the first weekly audit.

### **🌸 Spring (Apr - Jun 2026): The First Sprouts**

*   **Focus:** Growing the Global Commons, nurturing the first community contributions, and refining the AI-powered features.
*   **April:** `[Planned]` The Global Gallery v0.1: a read-only view of community prompts.
*   **May:** `[Planned]` One-Click Publish: the "Public Flag" for sharing your prompts with the world.
*   **June:** `[Planned]` The Proactive Librarian v0.2: suggesting related prompts and ideas.

### **☀️ Summer (Jul - Sep 2026): The Full Bloom**

*   **Focus:** Scaling the platform, fostering a vibrant community, and exploring new frontiers of AI-powered creativity.
*   **July:** `[Planned]` Collaborative Forking: allowing users to fork and improve community prompts.
*   **August:** `[Planned]` AI-Critiqued Prompts: an AI agent that helps you write better prompts.
*   **September:** `[Planned]` The Memory Palace v0.1: a 3D visualization of your knowledge base.

## 🍎 The Orchard: Harvesting Mature Ideas

This is where we turn our most promising seeds into concrete features. When a seed is ready to be harvested, we'll move it here and create a detailed spec for it.

*   *(No mature ideas have been harvested yet. Let's get planting!)*

## ♻️ The Compost: Ideas for Another Season

This is where we put ideas that are not a priority right now but might be revisited later. It's not a graveyard; it's a place for ideas to rest and ripen.

*   `Continuous-Claude-v3 Integration` — A powerful AI memory engine that could be integrated into 11-11 in the future.
*   `Enterprise & Compliance Features` — SSO, Slack/Teams notifications, and Jira/Linear sync.
*   `Monetization & Sustainability` — Donation models and rate-based monetization for high-volume API usage.
